      <h2>'In the ghetto" - Elvis Presley</h2>
      <p>
        As the snow flies On a cold and gray Chicago mornin' A poor little baby
        child is born In the ghetto And his mama cries 'Cause if there's one
        thing that she don't need It's another hungry mouth to feed In the
        ghetto People, don't you understand The child needs a helping hand Or
        he'll grow to be an angry young man some day Take a look at you and me,
        Are we too blind to see, Do we simply turn our heads And look the other
        way Well the world turns And a hungry little boy with a runny nose Plays
        in the street as the cold wind blows In the ghetto And his hunger burns
        So he starts to roam the streets at night And he learns how to steal And
        he learns how to fight In the ghetto Then one night in desperation The
        young man breaks the rules He buys a gun, steals a car, Tries to run,
        but he don't get far And his mama cries As a crowd gathers 'round an
        angry young man Face down on the street with a gun in his hand In the
        ghetto As her young man dies, On a cold and gray Chicago mornin',
        Another little baby child is born In the ghetto And his mama cries
